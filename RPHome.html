		<h1>Research Paper Toolbox</h1>
		<p>Constructing a research paper is an integral part of being a graduate student in the Information Architecture, Technical Communication
		and Information Design, and Technical Communication programs at IIT. </p>
		
		<p>There is no right or wrong way to put a paper together, but there are a wealth of tools available to make the process efficient and 
		manageable. In this course, you will find an explanation of the basic steps involved in writing a research paper, as well as a selection 
		of tools that complement certain steps. </p>
		
		<p>If you are new to writing research papers, this course will guide you through each of the basic steps; even if you are an experienced 
		writer, you can still refresh your knowledge with one or more lessons. To begin, choose a lesson by clicking one of the modules to the left.</p>
